Type,No.,Description,Notes
test,1,testing basic movement,-
test,2,test QR Scanning,-
test,3,test QR scanning with more logging,can't find the line that cause the error
test,4,added more logging,can't find the line that cause the error
test,5,new undistort method, more logging/Imgproc.undistort crashes the program
test,6,-,-
test,7,back to old undistort method, adjusted logging
test,8,change camdisMat to CvType.CV_64FC1,problem was with mat.put
test,9,scanning qr using imgproc.distort,imgproc.undistort works
test,10,crop more resize/ opencv qr reader/opencv qr reader doesn't work,
test,11,scan qr zxing,something broke after flashlight log
test,12,"more logging/ minor bug fix""",program seems to crash around zxing
test,13,more logging,Bitmap.createBitmap doesn't work
test,14,add +contrast -brightness +sharpen +logging,-
test,15,add +logging, QRCodeReader to MultiFormatReader
test,16,this should work,getting intArray crashes the program/ but I think its could be due to memory reason
test,17,opt memory,didn't help with error but good to be done
test,18,finding intArray error,found it
test,19,new intArray getting method,it worked but now it seems like things are too slow and the program got terminated beforehand
test,20,add +time stamp on logs,-
test,21,add +elapsedTime since start,-
test,22,back to normalbitmap,took toolong
test,23,test0022 but -sharpen -crop3 - crop4,took toolong
